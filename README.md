# Bird Species Classification Application

Project Overview: During my 3rd semester, my colleagues and I developed a Bird Species Classification Application utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 
This application was designed to accurately classify birds into five distinct species: Broadbill, Eagle, Owl, Parrot, and Woodpecker. The image dataset consist of 560 images, 420 for training and 140 for testing.

Technologies Used: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Python, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow, Keras

Key Features:

Machine Learning: Implemented CNN, a deep learning technique, to train and classify bird species based on image data.

Python and TensorFlow: Leveraged Python and TensorFlow for developing and training the model within the Jupyter Notebook environment.

Image Classification: Successfully categorized bird species with a focus on improving model accuracy and performance.

This project enhanced my understanding of machine learning, specifically in the areas of image classification and neural networks, while also sharpening my skills in Python programming and the use of deep learning frameworks.
